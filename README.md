# Event Classification with Naive Bayes Classifier

In this project categories of events are predicted by a Naive Bayes classifier from their names and
descriptions. A dataset over 1400 events of 34 categories is prepared by scraping several websites. Codes for
web scraping, text processing, feature vector generation, classification model, and performance evaluation of the classifier
are written.


**The code.ipynb file contains the code for the project.**
